.Before Start
====
You should have NO virtualservice, destinationrule, gateway or policy (in `tutorial` namespace) `istioctl get virtualservice` `istioctl get destinationrule` `istioctl get gateway` `istioctl get policy`
if so run:

In this chapter, we are going to see how to use Istio to promote a service to a more wide amount of users depending on their configuration.

[#what-is-promotion]
== What is a Service Promotion?

The idea behind service promotion is that you are able to promote your different versions of a service so it can be reached gradually by your public traffic.

What you define is different levels where your service is promoted, and in each of this level, the service is meant to be more stable than in the previous one.
You can think about graduating services to classes of users.

There are several ways of doing it, but one way we are using in http://www.openshift.io[OpenShift IO] is by allowing the user to choose if he wants to try the latest deployed version of the application (experimental level) or a stable version of the application (stable level).

This means that in the public cluster you have more than one version of the same service deployed, and the public traffic is able to reach it as well.

So let's see how to implement this approach using Istio.

[#deploy-recommendation-v3]
== Create recommendation:v3

[IMPORTANT]
=====
You need to be sure that you do not have a _recommendation:v3_ deployed in the cluster and that _recommendation_ code base is correct.

[source, bash]
----
oc get pods
or
kubectl get pods

NAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
customer-3600192384-fpljb             2/2       Running   0          17m
preference-243057078-8c5hz           2/2       Running   0          15m
recommendation-v1-60483540-9snd9     2/2       Running   0          12m
recommendation-v2-2815683430-vpx4p   2/2       Running   0         15s
----

To check if _recommendation_ source code is correct check that `getNow` method is not active.

[source, java]
.recommendation/java/vertx/src/main/java/com/redhat/developer/demos/recommendation/RecommendationVerticle.java
----
        router.get("/").handler(this::getRecommendations);
//        router.get("/").handler(this::getNow);
----

You might have a _recommendation:v3_ deployed because of you did xref:ROOT:8egress.adoc[Egress Section] ad not cleaned up the resources.

If it is the case you can follow the xref:ROOT:8egress.adoc#cleanup[Egress Clean Up Section].

If it is not the case then run:

[source, bash]
----
oc delete all -l app=recommendation,version=v3
or
kubectl delete all -l app=recommendation,version=v3
----

=====

We can experiment with Istio controlling traffic by making a change to `RecommendationVerticle.java` like the following and creating a "v3" docker image.

[source,java]
----
private static final String RESPONSE_STRING_FORMAT = "recommendation v3 from '%s': %d\n";
----

The "v3" tag during the Docker build is significant.

There is also a second `deployment.yml` file to label things correctly

=== Docker build (if you have access to Docker daemon)

[source,bash]
----
cd recommendation/java/vertx
mvn clean package

docker build -t example/recommendation:v3 .

docker images | grep recommendation
example/recommendation                  v3                  c31e399a9628        1 seconds ago      438MB
example/recommendation                  v2                  c31e399a9628        5 seconds ago      438MB
example/recommendation                  v1                  f072978d9cf6        8 minutes ago      438MB
----

IMPORTANT: We have a 3rd Deployment to manage the v3 version of recommendation. 

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f link:{github-repo}/{preference-repo}/kubernetes/Deployment-v3.yml[../../kubernetes/Deployment-v3.yml]) -n tutorial
oc get pods -w -n tutorial

or

kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f link:{github-repo}/{preference-repo}/kubernetes/Deployment-v3.yml[../../kubernetes/Deployment-v3.yml]) -n tutorial
kubectl get pods -w -n tutorial
----

=== OpenShift S2I strategy (if you DON'T have access to Docker daemon)

[source, bash]
----
mvn clean package -f recommendation/java/vertx
oc new-app -l app=recommendation,version=v3 --name=recommendation-v3 --context-dir=recommendation/java/vertx -e JAEGER_SERVICE_NAME=recommendation JAEGER_ENDPOINT=http://jaeger-collector.istio-system.svc:14268/api/traces JAEGER_PROPAGATION=b3 JAEGER_SAMPLER_TYPE=const JAEGER_SAMPLER_PARAM=1 JAVA_OPTIONS='-Xms128m -Xmx256m -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true' fabric8/s2i-java~https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/istio-tutorial -o yaml  > recommendation-v3.yml
oc apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f recommendation-v3.yml) -n tutorial
oc cancel-build bc/recommendation-v3 -n tutorial
oc delete svc/recommendation-v3 -n tutorial
oc start-build recommendation-v3 --from-dir=. --follow -n tutorial
----

=== Wait for v3 to be deployed

Wait for those pods to show "2/2", the istio-proxy/envoy sidecar is part of that pod.

[source,bash]
----
NAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
customer-3600192384-fpljb             2/2       Running   0          17m
preference-243057078-8c5hz           2/2       Running   0          15m
recommendation-v1-60483540-9snd9     2/2       Running   0          12m
recommendation-v2-2815683430-vpx4p   2/2       Running   0         15s
recommendation-v3-9834632434-urd34   2/2       Running   0         15s
----

and test the customer endpoint until you can see that v3 has been reached.

[source,bash]
----
curl customer-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io

[#feature-graduation]
== Feature Graduation

With 3 versions of service _recommendation_ deployed, now we can define 3 different level of access.
For example _experimental_, _beta_ and _production_.

With Istio, we can use routing for sending traffic depending on users configuration.

[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
istioctl create -f link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/destination-rule-recommendation-v1-v2-v3.yml[istiofiles/destination-rule-recommendation-v1-v2-v3.yml] -n tutorial
istioctl create -f link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/virtual-service-promotion-v1-v2-v3.yml[istiofiles/virtual-service-promotion-v1-v2-v3.yml] -n tutorial
----

Now, we need to set a header named `user-preference` with some specific value:

For version 3:: `123` (_experimental_)
For version 2:: `12` (_beta_)
For version 1:: _empty_ (_production_)

The reason behind using these approach is the next one.
In this example, we have three levels _experimental_, _beta_ and _production_, and we set a number to each level, 3 is the most unstable version while one is the most stable version.

So, for example, a user that sets its preferences to _experimental_ it means that he needs to reach _experimental_ or if no _eperimental_ then __beta_ or by default _production_. 
This effectively means setting that he wants to reach all levels `123`.
And the same applies to any other level defined by the user.

[source, bash]
----
curl -H "user-preference: 123" customer-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '6953441398-tyw25': 1

curl -H "user-preference: 12" customer-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '3490080923-usw67': 2

curl customer-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '9834514598-knc40': 10
----

One interesting point here is that if you open link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/virtual-service-promotion-v1-v2-v3.yml[istiofiles/virtual-service-promotion-v1-v2-v3.yml] you'll see that the header is set to `baggage-user-preference` meanwhile in `curl` it is set to `user-preference`.

The reason is that in _customer_ service (link:{github-repo}/master/customer/java/springboot/src/main/java/com/redhat/developer/demos/customer/CustomerController.java#L35[CustomerController.java]), `io.opentracing.Tracer` class is used to set as baggage item the `user-preference` header.
In this way, the header is populated across all services without having to copy it manually in each service, since by default headers are not populated automatically.

Now let's make a promotion of the versions, so _version 1_ is not reachable anymore, _version 2_ is the new _production_ and _version 3_ is the new _beta_.

[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
istioctl replace -f link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/virtual-service-promoted-v3.yml[istiofiles/virtual-service-promoted-v3.yml] -n tutorial
----

[source, bash]
----
curl -H "user-preference: 123" customer-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '6953441398-tyw25': 2

curl -H "user-preference: 12" customer-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '6953441398-tyw25': 3

curl customer-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '3490080923-usw67': 3
----

Notice that now the request with preference set to _experimental_ falls back to _beta_ as there is no _experimental_ version.

So versions of a service are promoted without having to redeploy anything nor changing your code.
