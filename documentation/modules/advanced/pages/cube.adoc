[IMPORTANT]
.Before Start
====
You should have NO virtualservice nor destinationrule (in `tutorial` namespace) `istioctl get virtualservice` `istioctl get destinationrule` 
if so run:

[source, bash]

./scripts/clean.sh

== Preparation

IMPORTANT: We are assuming that you have recommendation v1 and v2 deployed on `tutorial` namespace.

The first thing you need to do is to apply Istio resources to redirect all traffic to recommendation v1.

From the main istio-tutorial directory,

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
istioctl create -f link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/destination-rule-recommendation-v1-v2.yml[istiofiles/destination-rule-recommendation-v1-v2.yml] -n tutorial
istioctl create -f link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/virtual-service-recommendation-v1.yml[istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-v1.yml] -n tutorial

curl customer-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '2819441432-qsp25': 3
----

Now you see that your _production_ traffic always goes to recommendation v1.

[#explanation]
== Explanation

*Dark Launching* is a process where software is selectively or stealthily released to your users to validate that this new version behaves correctly and into expected parameters.

There are many techniques under *Dark Launch* technique, you've seen one in this tutorial xref:ROOT:5advanced-routerules.adoc#mirroringtraffic[Mirroring Traffic], in this case, we are going to see how you can make that your tests (even BDD tests) can be used to test your new version without affecting your current users.

You might need to use this technique if, for example, you don't want to start stressing your new service with public traffic at first (like happens in _Mirroring Traffic_ technique at first.

To write these tests you can use http://www.arquillian.org/arquillian-cube[Arquillian Cube].

Arquillian Cube allows you to control Docker, Kubernetes and OpenShift containers in your tests with ease.
As a side effect, it also supports Istio, so you can write tests that apply some Istio rules to configured cluster, runs the test, and finally restores the state of Istio.

For this use case what you want is to execute an automatic test against _recommendation v2_ meanwhile public traffic still goes to _recommendation v1_.
For this concrete example and for sake of simplicity, we set that if `user-agent` header contains *DarkLaunch* string then traffic is redirected to _v2_.

_Recommendation_ project comes with a test that it is ready to be executed, but in the next section, you'll read how we have arrived at the given solution.

[#code]
=== Code

The first things you need to do is adding `Arquillian Cube` dependency in _recommendation_ project.

[source, xml]
.recommendation/java/vertx/pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.cube</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-cube-openshift-starter</artifactId> <!--1-->
    <version>${cube.version}</version> <!--2-->
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.cube</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-cube-istio-kubernetes</artifactId> <!--3-->
    <version>${cube.version}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
<1> Dependency for OpenShift. There is also the same for Kubernetes.
<2> Version 1.18.2 or beyond.
<3> Dependency for Istio integration.

Then you need to configure the namespace of the project.
For this purpose, you need to create an `arquillian.xml` file.

[source, xml]
.recommendation/java/vertx/src/test/resources/arquillian.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<arquillian xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">

  <extension qualifier="openshift"> <!--1-->
    <property name="namespace.use.existing">tutorial</property> <!--2-->
    <property name="env.init.enabled">false</property> <!--3-->
  </extension>

</arquillian>
----
<1> OpenShift cluster.
<2> Use existing namespace named `tutorial`.
<3> Do not initialize anything, application is already running.

INFO: Arquillian Cube can also create a namespace and deploy any Kubernetes/OpenShift resource automatically. But since the application has been already deployed in xref:ROOT:2deploy-microservices.adoc[Deploy Microservices], this step is skipped.

And finally, you need to create an automatic test that runs against _v2_.

In this kind of tests you only want to validate _happy path_, just a quality gate that allows you to validate that everything is in place.

----
<1> Arquillian JUnit runner.
<2> Resource to apply *before* executing the test.
<3> Resource to apply *after* executing the test.
<4> Public `URL` of application.
<5> `IstioAssistant` instance to interact with Istio ecosystem.
<6> Waits until Istio resources are populated acorss the cluster.
<7> Test to validate that _recommendation v2_ works as expected.
<8> Creates a _request_ setting `user-agent` as *DarkLaunch*.
<9> Validates the response.

[TIP]
====
You've seen a simple example here, but you can use other strategies to get the same effect:

. Instead of using `user-agent` you can create a custom header, or just use the request IP range.
. `@IstioResource` and `@RestoreIstioResource` supports expressions like `$\{prop\}` resolving the property from environment variables or system properties.
. Use `failsafe` plugin to run this kind of tests so they are not run all the time.
. This example works with OpenShift route, but you can use `@PortForwarding` annotation in the test to do a port forwarding to given service.
. It is so important to add a guard to wait until Istio resources are populated across the cluster. In case of minishift/kube it is almost instantly but in case of real clusters, it might take some tenths of seconds.
