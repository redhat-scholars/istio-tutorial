=== Observing microservice meshes with Kiali

At some point when you are developing your microservice architecture, you will
need to visualize what is happening in your service mesh. You will have
questions like “Which service is connected to which other service?” and “How
much traffic goes to each microservice?” But because of the loosely tied nature
of microservice architectures , these questions can be difficult to answer.

Those are the kinds of question that Kiali has the ability to answer, by giving
you a big picture of the mesh, and showing the whole flow of your requests and
data.

==== How does Kiali work?

Kiali taps into the data provided by Istio and OpenShift to generate its
visualizations. It fetches ingress data (such as request tracing with Jaeger),
the listing and data of the services, health indexes, and so on.

Kiali runs as a service together with Istio, and does not require any changes
to Istio or Openshift configuration (besides the ones required to install
Istio).

==== How to install Kiali?

A prerequisite for installing Kiali is that you must have OpenShift and Istio
installed and configured.

Install Kiali with the following commands:

[source, bash]
----
# This command installs Kiali's configmaps
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/kiali/master/deploy/openshift/kiali-configmap.yaml | \
   VERSION_LABEL=master envsubst | oc create -n istio-system -f -

# This command installs Kiali's secrets
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/kiali/master/deploy/openshift/kiali-secrets.yaml | \
   VERSION_LABEL=master envsubst | oc create -n istio-system -f -

# And this command installs the Kiali service
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/kiali/master/deploy/openshift/kiali.yaml | \
   IMAGE_NAME=kiali/kiali \
   IMAGE_VERSION=latest \
   NAMESPACE=istio-system \
   VERSION_LABEL=master \
   VERBOSE_MODE=4 envsubst | oc create -n istio-system -f -
----

Installing Kiali may take a minute or two. You can use the following commands
to see if the service is running:

[source, bash]
----
oc project istio-system
oc get pods -w
----

Wait until the status for Kiali is `Running` and there are `1/1` pods in the
`Ready` column. To exit, press `Ctrl+C`.

[source, bash]
----
oc project istio-system
oc get routes
----

And you'll see a result that's something like this:

[source, bash]
----
NAME                   HOST/PORT                                                PATH      SERVICES               PORT              TERMINATION   WILDCARD

So now we have the URL for Kiali (usually,
"kiali-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io"), so let's access it:

image:docs/images/kiali-login.png[Login Page]

The default credentials are "admin/admin", but it's recommended to change them
before using it in production.

==== Generating Sample Data

To show the capabilities of Kiali, you'll need an Istio-enabled application to
be running. For this, we can use the `customer-tutorial` application we created
earlier.

To generate data for it, we can `curl` it with this command:

[source, bash]
----
curl customer-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io
----

==== Service Graph

After you login, you should see the Service Graph page:

image:docs/images/kiali-service-graph.png[Service Graph Page]

It shows a graph with all the microservices, connected by the requests going
through then. On this page, you can see how the services interact with each
other.

==== Service Listing

Click the Services link in the left navigation. On the Services page you can
view a listing of all the services that are running in the cluster, and
additional information about them, such as health status.

image:docs/images/kiali-service-list.png[Service Listing Page]

Click on the "Filter by Namespace" dropdown, and select "tutorial". Then,
you'll see a list of only the services on the tutorial:

image:docs/images/kiali-service-list-2.png[Service Listing Page Filtered]

Click on the "preference" to see its details:

image:docs/images/kiali-service-details.png[Service Details]

By hovering the icon on the Health section, you can see the health of a service
(a service is considered healthy) when it's online and responding to requests
without errors:

image:docs/images/kiali-service-health.png[Health Status]

You can also see the deployments:

image:docs/images/kiali-deployments.png[Deployments]

And the source services:

image:docs/images/kiali-source-services.png[Source Services]

And the virtual services on the Istio infrastructure (if you defined any before
on the tutorial). This one is from the "recommendation" service, where I
defined a timeout rule:

image:docs/images/kiali-virtual-services.png[Virtual Services]

Click on the name of the virtual service, and you'll see the details for the
virtual service:

image:docs/images/kiali-virtual-services-2.png[Virtual Services Details]

==== Istio Config

Click the Istio Config link on the left navigation. On this page, you can see
all currently running config rules, such as Virtual Services, Route Rules,
Routes, Circuit Breakers, Fault Injection and so on.

image:docs/images/kiali-istio-config.png[Istio Config Page]

==== Distributed Tracing

Click on the Distributed Tracing link in the left navigation. On this page you
can see the distributed tracing, as provided by Jaeger.

image:docs/images/kiali-distributed-tracing.png[Distributed Tracing Page]

==== Cleanup (Uninstalling Kiali)

To uninstall Kiali from your cluster, run the following command:

[source, bash]
----
oc delete all,secrets,sa,templates,configmaps,deployments,clusterroles,clusterrolebindings,virtualservices,destinationrules --selector=app=kiali -n istio-system
----
